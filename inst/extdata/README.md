# Population Comparison Data

The datasets are

 * Equatorial Guinea level 2 admin shapefiles from GADM (m).

 * Worldpop population map (m)

 * Landscan population map. Requires login process to https://landscan.ornl.gov/.

 * High-resolution settlement layer. Will become available at https://www.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/hrsl/.

The first two, marked with (m), can be downloaded by running
